Hi Team

 User who had Webex assitance and automated close captioning enabled 

They want to use manual closed captioning for their Webinars
While investigating , I found this article -https://help.webex.com/en-us/article/ng387ab/Manage-notes,-meeting-minutes,-and-closed-captions-in-Webex-Meetings-and-WebexWebinars
Which says"If you have Webex Assistant for Meetings or automated closed captions, you cannot assign a closed captionist for manual closed captions. Additionally, if you have Webex Assistant for Meetings, the Captions & Highlights panel replaces the Closed Captions panel."

However I found a BEMS where (BEMS01446990) where if we turn of the toggle"SupportSeparatedCCAbility" , and disable the Webex assistant on org level , we can assign manual closed captionist in Webex meetings  , I tested with my Test site and it is possible for Webex meetings however same is not replicating in Webinars , so just wanted to confirm if this is a limitation in Webinars or is there any other toggle that does the trick for Webinars
